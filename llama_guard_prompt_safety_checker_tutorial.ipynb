        "Welcome to this hands-on tutorial where we explore how to use **Llama Guard**, a safety-aware model, to evaluate **inputs** and **outputs** of LLMs like LLaMA 2/3! 🤖\n",

        "In this notebook, you'll discover:\n",
        "- ✅ How to build a **policy-aware safety filter** using Llama Guard.\n",
        "- 💬 The difference between filtering **User prompts** and **Assistant replies**.\n",
        "- 🛠️ The power of **prompt engineering** and structured formatting (ChatML) to enforce responsible behavior.\n",

        "By the end of this tutorial, you’ll be able to:\n",
        "- Design safe prompting strategies.\n",
        "- Use role-based classification (`User`, `Agent`) with clear task instructions.\n",
        "- Apply safety checks before and after model response.\n",
